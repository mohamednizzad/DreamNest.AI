![DreamNest UI](https://storage.googleapis.com/aistudio-ux-team-data/promo-images/dreamnest-promo.png)

## 🌟 Core Idea

DreamNest is an innovative AI platform that transforms user-defined house requirements into a complete, visualized home design package. Users can input parameters like plot size, number of rooms, and architectural style, and instantly receive AI-generated blueprints, photorealistic images, a voice-guided walkthrough, a 3D video tour, and a curated shopping list for materials and furniture.

This project serves as a powerful demonstration of the multimodal capabilities of the Google Gemini API, integrating text, image, and video generation into a cohesive and user-friendly web application.

## ✨ Features

- **Intuitive Input Form:** A simple, multi-section form for users to specify their dream home parameters.
- **AI-Powered Generation:** Leverages the Gemini API for a suite of generated assets:
  - **Photorealistic Renderings:** High-quality interior and exterior images generated by Imagen.
  - **Blueprint Description:** A detailed textual layout of the home's floor plan.
  - **Voice-Guided Walkthrough:** An eloquent, AI-generated script describing the home's features, complete with text-to-speech playback.
  - **3D Video Tour:** A cinematic video walkthrough of the designed property (feature is commented out by default to manage costs).
  - **Curated Shopping List:** A shoppable list of furniture and decor that matches the home's style.
- **Interactive Results Display:** A polished and organized view of all generated assets.
- **Day/Night Mode:** A sleek, persistent theme toggle for user comfort.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great experience on all devices.
- **Real-time Progress:** A dynamic loading screen that provides users with status updates during the generation process.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
  - `gemini-2.5-flash` for text and JSON generation.
  - `imagen-4.0-generate-001` for image generation.
  - `veo-2.0-generate-001` for video generation.
- **Deployment:** Runs in any modern web browser supporting ES6 modules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or set up the files):**
    Ensure all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, etc.) are in the same directory.

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key. This key must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

    *In a local development environment, you would typically create a `.env` file and add your key:*
    ```
    API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The application will start, and you can begin designing your dream home.
